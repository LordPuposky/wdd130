        <p>Welcome! I'm Yesid Romero, a passionate web developer, lifelong learner,
            and a purpose-driven professional. After years of experience in sales leadership,
            I chose to reinvent myself through web development and now specialize in building
            responsive, accessible, and meaningful websites.

            I believe technology should serve people, not the other way around. My work blends
            technical skill with human-centered design, aiming to create digital experiences that
            are both functional and inspiring.

            Whether you're here to explore my projects, collaborate on a vision, or simply connect
            I'm glad you stopped by. Let's build something with purpose. </p>
