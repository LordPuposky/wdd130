This HTML file demonstrates a basic Holy Grail layout using semantic elements such as <header>, <nav>, <main>, <section>, <aside>, and <footer>.

It was created as part of Week 02 of the WDD 130: Web Fundamentals course at BYU-Idaho.

The layout includes:

A site header with a main title

A navigation menu with external links

A main content area with two sections

An image of a temple in the sidebar

A footer with the student's name

No CSS styling is applied yet â€” this file focuses purely on semantic HTML structure.
